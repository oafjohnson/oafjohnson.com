        <h2>What is oafjohnson.com?</h2>
        <p>oafjohnson.com is the home for things that are fun that I like. I plan on uploading book, movie, music, and game reviews as well as all videos from my <a href="https://youtube.com/@oafjohnson" target="_blank">youtube channel.</a> Also maybe if I draw something I like or record a song or something that too. In the future I'll make this thing pretty bitchin and kind of just use it as my blog. For now it's this.</p>
